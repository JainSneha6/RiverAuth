# RiverAuth - Behaviour Based Continuous Authentication System

> A real-time, resource-efficient, and privacy-compliant solution for continuous mobile authentication using user behavior signals.

## Problem Statement

Traditional authentication methods (passwords, OTPs, biometrics) are **static** and vulnerable to post-login threats like:

- Session hijacking
- Account takeovers
- Fraudulent transactions

### We Solve This By:
Implementing **Behaviour-Based Authentication (BBA)** that monitors real-time interaction patterns like taps, swipes, typing behavior, and navigation flow to continuously verify user identity â€” without interrupting user experience.

---

## Key Features

- Real-time anomaly detection
- Lightweight mobile-first architecture
- Continuous learning via streaming model updates
- Privacy-first approach, DPDP Act compliant
- Context-aware detection (e.g., travel, new device)

## ðŸ› System Components

### 1. Behaviour Capture Engine
Captures a rich set of behavioral data:
- **Geolocation**
- **Swipe gestures**
- **Tap pressure**
- **Typing behavior**
- **Device metadata**

### 2. Real-Time Anomaly Detector
- Detects deviation using:
  - `KMeans + Mahalanobis Distance` for geo-behavior
  - `HalfSpaceTrees` (a variant of Isolation Forest) for gestures and typing
- Drift-aware & unsupervised: no labeled data needed

### 3. Adaptive Access Restriction
- Dynamically adjusts access based on anomaly score:
  - Low: Full access
  - Medium: Security re-authentication
  - High: Immediate logout

### 4. Continuous Model Feedback Loop
- Stream processing with **incremental learning**
- Uses **sliding window** and **concept drift adaptation**
